# Face-Aging-with-cGAN

This repository is an attemption of implementing face aging with cGAN according to the paper by Grigory Antipov, Moez Baccouche and Jean-Luc Dugelay.

I'll try cycle-GAN for the aging task first. If it fails, the method in the paper would be applied.

Let's rock it.

Progress:
